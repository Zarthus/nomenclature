I enjoy writing software in systematic languages, I am biased towards languages like Rust (for robust software), or Go and Ruby (for quick proof of concepts)

I am most comfortable with backend languages, devops, and UX evaluation. It usually takes significantly longer to set up a decently looking frontend for me.
