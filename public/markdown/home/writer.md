As you might've gathered, a lot of world building involves writing -- but also programming (especially if documentation is in your definition of done).

I brainstorm ideas, craft entirely new systems, write notes, short stories. I pretty much write all the time.

This can be my downfall, as I usually am referred to as a [little bit too verbose](/flaws#too-verbose).
