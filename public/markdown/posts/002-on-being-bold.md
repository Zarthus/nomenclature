This is not directly a value of mine, but I do consider it a [strength](/strengths#action-on-actionables).

There are many ways to phrase this: Being bold, A pioneer, getting things done, etc.

Most companies have some kind of value that relates to "don't let yourself be blocked, get things done.". Trivago has [We take Ownership](https://careers.trivago.com/working-culture/), at HackerOne it is [Act Like An Owner](https://www.hackerone.com/company-news/together-we-hit-harder-hackerone-company-values), and for GitLab
it's under [Results > Bias for action](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#bias-for-action) and [Results > Disagree, commit, and disagree](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#disagree-commit-and-disagree), yet the reality we see is that people are still relatively slow and waiting for other parties, which can push times to deliver up by weeks rather than hours.

Historically, I've worked for a couple of startups, and that's where this type of culture is very much active, but
also much easier to accomplish: When there's only three, two, or even just a single team - it's so much easier
to get things over a finish line than if there's 10+ of them. But even at the bigger companies I've been able to be a pioneer at getting things done.

### So how do I do it?

I consider this to be a [strength of mine](/strengths#action-on-actionables). So how do I do it?

#### 1. If you want to do it, it's probably because you care.

Passion, Enthousiasm, or thinking it's the right thing to do are very good motivators, and that's motivation that can
be turned into fuel to be efficient. This means you might've already done some research into the subject to ensure
your mind is convinced this is a good approach, or maybe it's just a subject you are very passionate about.

If you don't want to do it, but it's still on your radar, maybe that's because it's something that requires urgent
action, such as an incident or important customer feedback.

#### 2. Don't be afraid to step on people's toes.

A lot of people get stuck trying to not to offend or step on people's toes: yet the reality is that many people are
very appreciative if you get a ball rolling, and sometimes it's just easier and faster to apologize rather than ask
for permission.

#### 3. Consider the Ask

Is this a complicated ask, or are you doing something rather innocent?

If it's complicated, it probably warrants some investigation, if it's simple: Just do it.

Once there is something tangible it's much easier to convince people to collaborate or unblock you.

#### 4. Timeboxing is your friend

Timeboxing helps you from not getting _too_ distracted from your goals. I document this in the
[value: Allow Distractions, When They Make Sense](/values#allow-distractions-when-they-make-sense)

#### 5. Consider the Risk, Most Decisions Can Be Reverted

What is the risk that your action would be catastrophic or poorly received? You'll find it's very often
it's not very significant, especially because...

People often forget that nothing is set in stone. Especially in my profession, it's easy to revert things.

#### 6. Make mistakes

Everything in life is a learning process. You'll get better at this the more you do it :)

People will recover, most people stay upset about something for a maximum of 3 months. It costs
energy to be upset about things.

### This is not about rushing decisions

It's important to note that this is not about rushing decisions. It's about _you_ being confident enough that
this is the right path forward that you involve as little amount of people necessary to move things forward
and not allow yourself to be blocked, and the fact that once tangible data exists people will be much easier
to convince. If you haven't properly thought things through, you should do that first before rolling it out.

In some cases, in addition, "just doing it" will give you insights you haven't had before, maybe you haven't
thought something through but are wondering if it's the right direction. In that case,
[Prototyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_prototyping) is a very valid strategy to see if it makes
sense.

### Do revert if it doesn't work out, roll back early - but not immediately.

Explicit mention: You'll make mistakes, be ready to revert them or otherwise you're introducing needless
technical debt, conflict, or long-term effects.

Some big decisions made in companies I've worked at before were never reverted, and they're still considered
a pain point to this day. It takes guts to say "I'm sorry, I messed up. I think many of us agree this change is
not for long term health of the company, and we will be rolling back this change".

Don't revert immediately (it takes time to build evidence and get used to change), but do revert "soon".

### Edge cases: Security, Privacy, Database Changes, Areas you have no knowledge on.

Just quickly writing it out here, but some tasks are rarely for an individual to decide:

-   Security decisions probably should have at least peer review
-   Privacy changes should probably have a peer review.
-   Database Changes really should be looked at by another person.
-   If you don't know anything about the subject, consider asking a subject matter expert for additional thoughts.

### note: I'm just a person on the Internet

Complexity lives everywhere. Some company cultures may not support this, this advice may not apply to your role
or to your job. Some toxic personalities may be easier to live under the radar for until you've found better
opportunities.
