For the last 5 years, I've always tried to make a dent in Advent of Code, but I usually stop after day 4 or 5 because
the solutions take more time or brainpower to complete, and keeping that up for 25 days is a long grind.

I started being more successful last year and this year once I started *timeboxing my solutions*, by which I mean,
I'm dedicating one or two hours per day to a challenge, and if I don't make it - that's okay.

For me, hope would usually dwindle if the backlog started growing, and demotivation would crawl in:

If I couldn't finish Day 10, I'd now have to do _finish_ Day 10 and _start_ Day 11 on the same day.

By timeboxing solutions you give yourself a different finish line, and one you can always complete:
"After 2 hours of trying, my solution is whatever I've got at that moment", and finishing earlier just gives you that
time back.

Once I started doing this, I became more consistent in practicing Advent of Code days.

## We do the same for household chores

Whenever I need to vacuum or clean the house, I do the same: I set goals I can achieve, such as "finish one room", or
"do it for 30 minutes" - and this mindset works, it's tricking your brain and making goals more achieveable gives you
the same level of happiness and ultimately gets more stuff done. You're in it for the long con when it comes to
repeating tasks.

## Time management

Recently, the [REWORK podcast, during their episode 'Calendar Tetris'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoSqQgaNq4M)
talked about how calendars should be "busy by default" and that you should carve out time for other people -
while not exactly the same thing, it may help to think of timeboxing is just another way of doing so.

"My day is this full, and I'll allocate 1 hour of focus time to this specific thing"
